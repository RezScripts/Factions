# Factions
Minecraft custom faction fork.

All the features have to be edited either with in the config or in the code it self as some features are hard coded.

Depends: WorldEdit, WorldBorder & Vault

Supports: 1.8

Features include:
* Koth
* Facitons Top / Spawner value check (Iterates through all worlds)
* Factions Upgrade (Customizable lore & names.) 
* Factions Chat

I will not be contributing anymore code to this project as it is old. 
Feel free to send pull request I will accept if it useful & can help others.
